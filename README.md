# veles.sound_feature_extraction
C++ library to extract various features from audio signal. Additionally, provides some DSP functions.

Designed without any OS portability in mind, tested only on Linux. Can work on BSD/Darwin after some potentially minor adaptation. Supports Android build.

Written with heavy usage of C++11 and can be built with either GCC or Clang.
Incorporates [simd](https://github.com/Samsung/veles.simd) and [FFTF](https://github.com/Samsung/FFTF) libraries. IIR filtering is implemented on top of
[DSPFilters](https://github.com/vmarkovtsev/DSPFilters).

Employs a modular architechture, where any feature extraction pipeline is constructed from dedicated, specialized units called "transforms".
The unique feature of this library is that several different features can be extracted at the same time, resulting in a tree of transforms,
which reuse the buffer space and are properly scheduled thanks to an advanced allocation and schedule subsystem.

There are Python bindings.
